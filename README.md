## exif2db

Scan your photo library and store photo metadata into an Sqlite database.

Gain full control over file indexing and search! Abandon the photo management
tools that do only one half and cannot do another half of work that you need.

The module scans your photo collection and populates an SQLite database with
the most essential information, so that later you can use power of SQL and
relational database to perform any kind of search and analysis.
